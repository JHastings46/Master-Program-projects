    "# Dataset Overview-Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains real estate metrics across various regions in the United States. It spans from February 2018 to May 2024, providing temporal data that captures trends over a significant period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Attributes/Dimensions**:\n",
    "1. **RegionID**: A unique identifier for each region.\n",
    "2. **SizeRank**: A ranking of regions based on their size.\n",
    "3. **RegionName**: The name of the region (e.g., \"Los Angeles, CA\").\n",
    "4. **StateName**: The name of the state (e.g., \"CA\").\n",
    "5. **Date-specific Columns**:\n",
    "   - **HomeValue**: Represents the average home value for a specific month and region.\n",
    "   - **DaysPending**: Indicates the number of days a property remains pending before a transaction is completed.\n",
    "   - **CutRaw**: Reflects the average price reduction or adjustment of home values in a specific city or region during a particular month. This metric is useful for understanding how much sellers are willing to lower their listing prices to attract buyers, giving insight into market health and supply-demand dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Dimensions**:\n",
    "- **Temporal**: The dataset provides monthly data points, making it suitable for time-series analysis.\n",
    "- **Spatial**: It covers various regions in the U.S., enabling comparative analysis across different geographic locations.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Key metrics include home values, days pending, and price reductions, which are crucial for analyzing real estate trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for Working with the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goals for analyzing this dataset revolve around understanding market trends, dynamics, and potential investment opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze Trends in Price Reductions (CutRaw)**: Identify how average price reductions have changed over time across different regions. Determine which areas have more volatile or stable pricing adjustments, indicating market conditions like supply-demand balance, buyer confidence, or economic shifts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Understand Market Liquidity through Days Pending**: Explore the trends in \"DaysPending\" across regions to infer market liquidity. For instance, a lower number of days pending may suggest a seller's market (high demand and low supply), whereas a higher number might indicate a buyer's market (low demand and high supply).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correlate Home Values with Market Liquidity**: Investigate the relationship between average home values and days pending to understand if higher-value properties tend to stay longer or sell faster in different regions, providing insight into the market segments' attractiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Visualizations \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Chart for Average Price Reductions (CutRaw) Over Time by Region**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Scatter Plot Showing Home Values vs. Days Pending Across Regions**:\n"

    "# Sketching Your Data - Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Identifying a Distinct Problem\n",
    "**Problem**: Understanding real estate market dynamics to help potential homebuyers and investors make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves analyzing factors like home values, time on the market, price reductions (e.g., \"CutRaw\"), and their relationships across different cities and time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Define Two Tasks Using the \"Who, What, When, Where, Why, How\" Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Identify Cities with the Most Significant Price Reductions Over Time\n",
    "- **Who**: Homebuyers, real estate investors, agents.\n",
    "- **What**: Average price reductions (CutRaw) in cities over time.\n",
    "- **When**: Monthly, from 2018 to 2024.\n",
    "- **Where**: Various cities in the United States.\n",
    "- **Why**: To find investment opportunities with significant property discounts.\n",
    "- **How**: Line chart visualizing price reduction trends for multiple cities over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Determine Correlation Between Time on Market and Home Values\n",
    "- **Who**: Real estate analysts, market researchers, financial institutions.\n",
    "- **What**: Relationship between days on market (DaysPending) and home values.\n",
    "- **When**: Monthly data from 2018 to 2024.\n",
    "- **Where**: Different states and cities in the US.\n",
    "- **Why**: To understand selling time based on property value and inform pricing strategies.\n",
    "- **How**: Scatter plots with regression lines to visualize correlations between home values and days on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Designing Visualizations to Accomplish These Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Design for Task 1: Price Reductions Over Time\n",
    "- **Type**: Line Chart with Multiple Series\n",
    "- **Details**: Line chart with multiple lines for different cities; X-axis is time (2018-2024, monthly), Y-axis is average price reduction (CutRaw). Different colors for each city.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Compare trends in price reductions across cities to identify those with the most significant reductions.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Interactive tooltips to show values on hover.\n",
    "  - Filters to focus on specific cities.\n",
    "  - Legend to identify city lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Design for Task 2: Correlation Between Time on Market and Home Values\n",
    "- **Type**: Scatter Plot with Regression Line\n",
    "- **Details**: Scatter plot showing each city's average home value vs. average days on market (DaysPending). X-axis is home values; Y-axis is days on market.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Visualize correlation between property prices and time to sell, helping understand market liquidity and pricing strategies.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Regression line to indicate trends.\n",
    "  - Interactive filters to highlight specific regions or states.\n"

    "# Line Chart of Average Price Reduction Over Time by Region\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart is a **line plot** that visualizes the **Average Price Reduction (CutRaw)** over time across different regions in the United States. This chart provides a comparative analysis of how average price reductions in real estate have fluctuated in various cities and regions over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Plot**:\n",
    "   - The line plot shows how the **Average Price Reduction** has changed over time for different regions.\n",
    "   - Each line represents a different **RegionName** (city or region), allowing for easy comparison between them.\n",
    "   - The y-axis represents the **Average Price Reduction (CutRaw)** in USD, while the x-axis represents the **Date**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time-Series Data**:\n",
    "   - The x-axis represents **Date**, ranging from April of a given year to the following April, capturing a multi-year time span.\n",
    "   - The chart shows fluctuations in price reductions at regular time intervals (months), highlighting seasonal trends and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Axes**:\n",
    "   - **X-Axis (Date)**: Displays the timeline, formatted by months and years (e.g., April, October), allowing for an easy understanding of time progression.\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis (Average Price Reduction (CutRaw))**: Represents the average amount of price reduction in USD, ranging from 0 to 50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Legend**:\n",
    "   - A legend on the right side of the chart identifies each region by color and provides easy reference for interpretation. This is essential for understanding which line corresponds to which region.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **United States** line (black) provides a national average baseline, allowing for comparisons with individual cities.\n",
    "- Some regions, such as **Los Angeles, CA** (green), show significant fluctuations and higher average price reductions compared to others, suggesting more volatile market conditions.\n",
    "- Other regions, like **New York, NY** (purple) and **Washington, DC** (grey), display relatively stable trends with less fluctuation in average price reductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This line chart is an effective tool for visualizing and comparing the trends in average price reductions across different regions over time. It helps identify regions with volatile market conditions and provides insights into seasonal patterns and market dynamics in the real estate sector.\n"

    "# Scatter Plot of Average Home Value vs. Days Pending by City (Filtered)\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart is a **scatter plot with an interactive dropdown filter** that visualizes the relationship between the **Average Home Value** and the **Average Days Pending** for different cities. The chart is created using Altair, a declarative statistical visualization library for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scatter Plot**:\n",
    "   - The scatter plot represents data points where the x-axis shows the **Average Home Value** and the y-axis shows the **Average Days Pending** for real estate properties.\n",
    "   - Each data point represents a combination of home value and days pending for a specific date and city.\n",
    "   - All data points are displayed in plain blue, regardless of the selected city.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Dropdown Filter**:\n",
    "   - A dropdown menu is available on the bottom left side of the chart titled **\"City\"**. The dropdown allows users to select a specific city from a list of available options.\n",
    "   - When a city is selected from the dropdown, the scatter plot dynamically updates to show only the data points relevant to that city.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trend Line (Regression Line)**:\n",
    "   - A red trend line is overlaid on the scatter plot to indicate the linear regression (trend) of the data points for the selected city.\n",
    "   - This line helps to visualize the correlation between home values and days pending, showing whether there is a positive or negative trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Axes**:\n",
    "   - **X-Axis**: Represents the **Average Home Value** ranging from 0 to 1,000,000 in USD.\n",
    "   - **Y-Axis**: Represents the **Average Days Pending**, ranging from 0 to 65 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tooltip**:\n",
    "   - When hovering over a data point, a tooltip appears that provides detailed information, including:\n",
    "     - **Date**: The specific date of the data point.\n",
    "     - **Avg Home Value**: The average home value on that date.\n",
    "     - **City**: The name of the city (in this example, \"Los Angeles\").\n",
    "     - **Avg Days on Market**: The average number of days the property remained pending on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scatter plot shows the dispersion of data points and indicates how the home values relate to the number of days properties remain pending.\n",
    "- The downward trend of the red regression line suggests a **negative correlation** between the **Average Home Value** and **Average Days Pending** in the selected city. This could indicate that higher-value homes tend to spend fewer days on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart effectively visualizes the relationship between home values and market time across different cities, making it a powerful tool for data exploration and analysis in real estate.\n"

Quantitative measures such as accuracy, time on task, and error rates will be recorded.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Qualitative Evaluation**: Combine observations with interviews to understand how participants use the visualizations in a more natural setting. This approach provides qualitative insights that complement the formal experiment results, helping us understand the context in which the visualizations are used and any potential challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Instantiating the Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Test Preparation:\n",
    "- Develop a set of realistic tasks and scenarios that participants must complete using the visualizations (e.g., identifying trends, comparing cities).\n",
    "- Prepare surveys, questionnaires, and interview scripts tailored to the participants' backgrounds and roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Participant Tasks:\n",
    "- **Task 1**: Use the line chart to identify the top 3 cities with the most significant price reductions over a specified period.\n",
    "- **Task 2**: Use the scatter plot to compare the trends of two selected cities and provide insights into their market dynamics.\n",
    "- **Task 3**: Use the visualizations to determine which city had the most consistent decrease in price reductions over time and understand the correlation with the time properties spent on the market.\n",
    "- **Task 4**: Evaluate the effectiveness of price reduction strategies by using the scatter plot to understand correlations between home values and days on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task will be followed by a set of questions to assess insight depth, accuracy, and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection:\n",

    "- Analyze quantitative data (e.g., time on task, accuracy) to identify any usability issues or patterns.\n",
    "- Analyze qualitative feedback to understand the depth of insights gained, user satisfaction, and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Criteria for Success\n",
    "To determine if the visualizations are successful, I will use the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Insight Depth Scores**: Participants should be able to extract meaningful insights about price reduction trends and understand correlations. At least 80% of participants should correctly identify key trends and patterns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **High Usability Scores**: A System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 70 or above, indicating that the visualizations are user-friendly and easy to interact with.\n",
